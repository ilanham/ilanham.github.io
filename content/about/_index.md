My name is Ian, and I work with data (usually lots of it). I currently work as a Data Engineer with some data science tasks added for additional insights. Before my current role, I worked as a Database Administrator on SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

My interests vary a lot in the field of data - I find parts of the data engineering, data science, data analysis, and visualization spaces equally fascinating. As it goes, I have an enormous list of side projects I don't get to develop to their full potential. My goal is to write and explore data as a cross-section. Often in my career, I have to explore all sections of the stack to trace data lineage and checking on quality.

Outside of technology, I love to travel with my family. My favorite way to travel is without a car whenever my vacation plans allow. Because of that, I like to focus on transportation datasets, specifically air and rail travel.
